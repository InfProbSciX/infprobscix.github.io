This is a record of the new ideas I learn in statistics and machine learning. I present content *as I understand it*, so please excuse mistakes :) Unreferenced content on this blog is probably original.

I'd absolutely love it if you could point out mistakes or offer different point of views by emailing me at _aditya.ravuri@gmail.com_ or by creating issues or pull requests on GitHub.

_**Please note that this blog is in very early days, so it probably has mistakes. I just quickly wanted to store my notes online so I don't lose them.**_
