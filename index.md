$$ l(\theta ; X) \equiv ln \left( p_{\mathcal M} (X | \theta) \right) $$


Models seem to be constructed by making them likely in the light of data but not such that they're able to reproduce it.

An interesting statement: "neural networks use finitely many highly adaptive basis functions whereas gaussian processes typically use infinitely many fixed basis functions" - paraphrased from Wilson et al. 2015, based on work by Neal, MacKay and others.
