I used to do a fair bit of astrophotography in university - it's harder to find good skies now living in the city. Here are some of my old pictures. I've kept making rookie mistakes (too much ISO, not much exposure time, using a slow lens, bad stacking, ...), for that I apologize!

## Moon

ISS Transit (it was super fast, but I managed to get this):

## Milky Way

## Solar System

Sun, sunspots, prominences, filaments, Mercury (taken during the solar transit), Venus at half phase, Moon (blue filter), Mars (opposition), Jupiter with Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Saturn with its moons, Uranus and moons, Neptune and Triton.

## Orion Nebula

## The Pillars of Creation

I'm so unreasonably proud of this even though it looks horrible. You can just make out the pillars on the left.

## Fireworks Galaxy with a Supernova

SN2017EAW. I also published this in a supernova catalog.

## Andromeda

One hour of exposure, rural Zambian sky.

## Ring nebula, M13, Crab nebula

## Star Trails

My first venture into astrophotography (Zambia). The picture on the right was taken during a meteor shower (can't remember which one, but one is visible on the bottom right).

## Einstein Cross

One of the leads of CUAS helped me locate the cross (thanks James!). I love this picture.

## Gear

### Telescopes

A lot of these (especially deep sky stuff) were taken using the 12" Northumberland telescope at Cambridge (I must've filled at least 25-33% of the logs the year I was there!). The Northumberland is a slow scope. I've also got a portable 4" scope that I've used for Andromeda and some planetary photography. Saturn was taken using a 16" scope at Harvard.

### Photography

Nikon D3300, although I also use the advanced camera feature on my phone a lot.

### Misc

Stuff that I actually use: a solar filter that I can't find anymore, 25mm, 9mm eyepieces and phone/camera/telescope mounts.

Stuff I wish I used more: a focal reducer that has helped take pictures of some sparrows (causes chromatic aberration or distortion), some planetary and one moon filters, a special filter for spectrum analysis (that I've used once *facepalm*, for QSO 3C 273).

### Stacking

Photoshop for touch-ups, RegiStax and Deep Sky Stacker for stacking (that I run with wine... I hate this process so much, lemme know of alternatives!)
