## Introduction

The log-likelihood function $$l$$ is a function such that:

$$\mathcal l(\theta; x) = ln \; p_{\mathcal M}(x|\theta)$$

... where p is the _generalized density_ under a model, evaluated on the dataset.

## Model Laws

 1. We can reason about the probability of failure in a repeated Bernoulli experiment even if no failures are observed! Assume that a process represented by $$X \sim Bin(n, p)$$ produces a set of $$n$$ successes. We can still construct a posterior by writing out the likelihood of this model. This would obviously include 0 (and the highest mass would be there) but an interval with a 5% error rate would be $$[0, 3/n]$$.

 2. When dealing with censored data, we can re-frame the problem and derive a likelihood. Here's my attempt at that:

	Let a random variable $$\tau$$ have a cumulative distribution function $$F_{\tau}$$.

	Now, let $$X$$ be a random variable such that:

	$$ X = \begin{cases} \tau,  & \text{if $\tau \leq T$} \\
	T, & \text{if $\tau \geq T$} \end{cases}$$

	Then, it's easy to see that the cumulative distribution function of $$X$$ is:

	$$ F_X(x) = \begin{cases} F_{\tau}(x),  & \text{if $x < T$} \\
	1, & \text{if $x \geq T$} \end{cases}$$

	Let $$\nu = l + \delta_T$$ be a reference measure that is the sum of the Lebesgue measure $$l$$ and the Dirac measure $$\delta_T$$ on the set $$\{T\}$$. Then, the density on $$X$$ will be a function $$h$$ (the Radon-Nikodym derivative) such that:

	$$ F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x h d\nu = \int_{-\infty}^x h(u) du * \mathcal I_{x < T} + h(T) \mathcal I_{x = T} $$

	A function that satisfies the form above is:

	$$h(u) =  \frac{dF_{\tau}}{du}(u) \mathcal I_{u < T} + (1 - F_{\tau}(T)) \mathcal I_{u = T}$$

## Dimensionality

### Volumes in High Dimensions

A lot of probability theory uses the idea of volumes. For example, the probability and expectation are usually defined as:

$$ \mathbb P_{\mu} (\mathcal A) = \int_A d \mu \;\;\; ; \;\;\; \mathbb E_{\mu} (f(X)) = \int_{\chi} f(x) d \mu(x) $$

... where the differential element is usually a volume, $$ d \mu(x) = p(x) dx_1 ... dx_d$$, and p is a density, but volumes are really weird in higher dimensions.

The main idea is that our ideas of _distance_ no longer make sense. Consider the following: I simulated a bunch of random normal points in many dimensions and plotted the average ratio of the distance to nearest point to the distance to farthest point:

<center> <img style="max-width: 500px; height: auto;" src = "/images/hidst.png"> </center>

This ratio tends to one, implying that the nearest and farthest points are equally "close" / all points "look alike".

On the same subject, consider a cube of unit lengths containing a sphere of unit radius in higher dimensions:

<center> <img style="max-width: 400px; height: auto;" src = "/images/cubes.png"> </center>
<center> <img style="max-width: 500px; height: auto;" src = "/images/sphre.png"> </center>

The edges of the cube keep more and more volume away from the sphere. In fact - the volume of a sphere starts decreasing after 5 dimensions.

### Typical Sets

Consider the following: In one dimension, if I draw from a normal distribution, numbers close to zero would be the most reasonable guess at what the draw could be. In higher dimensions, this isn't really the case - if I draw from a 1000-dimensional normal, it's ridiculously unlikely that I'd pick a vector that (0, 0, 0, ...); a more reasonable guess would be "a vector of points where the mean radius is ye much".

Now consider the likelihood of an isolated repeated experiment:

$$L(\theta | x) = \prod_i^n p(x_i|\theta)$$

This is a function of many random variables (which collectively have a dimension n). This will have it's own sampling distribution, and the position where it's maxmized w.r.t. any of the x's isn't a typical value of the likelihood at all.

Example:

{%highlight ruby%}

hist_fancy(replicate(10000, sum(log(dnorm(rnorm(100))))),
           main = "Typical Values of the Loglikelihood", xlab = "ll")

{% endhighlight %}

<center> <img style="max-width: 500px; height: auto;" src = "/images/typlk.png"> </center>

The maximum possible value of the loglikelihood in this case is -91.9, although it's always much lower than that. Loglikelihood values around -140 _for this experiment_ are _typical_.

We call values that lie in this region of typicality the ***typical set*** and it's geometry is expected to be weird. From the other results, we expect it to be a thin layer of mass lying on a shell somewhere in a high dimensional space. The booklet "Logic, Probability, and Bayesian Inference" by Betancourt & the Stan Dev Team has another such example.

From Andrew Gelman's blog: Interpolating between any two values of the typical set is rather unlikely to result in another typical sample. To sample from an arbitrary density, we can't use grid or ensemble based methods, so a logical alternative is to start with a sample and obtain another sample using it, which leads logically to the idea of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, at which the Hybrid/Hamiltonian method is rather efficient.
