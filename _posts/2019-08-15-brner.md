Consider:

$$ X|P \sim Bernoulli(P) $$

... where \\(X, P\\) are random variables. Then:

$$ \mathbb P(X = 1) = \int_0^1 \mathbb P(X = 1 | P = p) dF_P(p) = \int_0^1 p dF_P(p) = \mathbb E(P). $$

The distribution of \\(X\\) is _**only dependant on the expectation of**_ \\(P\\).

Another way to see this:

$$ \mathbb V (X) = \mathbb E_p (\mathbb V (X|p)) + \mathbb V_p (\mathbb E (X|p)) $$

$$ = \mathbb E_p (p(1 - p)) + \mathbb V_p (p) $$

$$ = \mathbb E_p(p) - \mathbb E_p (p^2) + \mathbb E_p (p^2) - \mathbb E_p^2 (p) $$

$$ = \mathbb E_p(p) (1 - \mathbb E_p(p)). $$

So, random probabilities, random hazard rates or 'random effects' across groups which have just one observation are probably meaningless to talk about.
