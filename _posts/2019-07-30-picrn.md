# Random Plots

## New York Conditional Taxi Dropoff Probabilities

I fit a twenty component mixture of multivariate normals to the four dimensional new york taxi pickup/dropoffs dataset. Then, conditioning on a (pickup) point, the conditional density by dropoff locations can be obtained:

## Modelling my d20 dice

I fit a spline on a sphere representing my d20. The color represents the model probabilities. The distance from the centre represents the proportion of times my dice fell on a particular number during six hundred trials.

## Envelope Modelling

Google's Quick Draw dataset contains multiple observations of quickly drawn envelopes. I fit a 256-component restricted boltzmann machine (heavily overparameterised; not a great model - I know) to the data, which represents a big nasty distribution over the random field that represents an envelope image. Now, starting off with a completely random image, using Gibbs sampling, we may obtain an envelope. Here's what the burn in looks like:
