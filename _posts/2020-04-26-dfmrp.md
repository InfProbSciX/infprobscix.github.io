The main aim here was to morph space inside a square but such that the transformation preserves some kind of ordering of the points. I wanted to use it to generate some random graphs on a flat surface and introduce spatial deformation to make the graphs more interesting.

I've got no idea how to do this. I believe that I'm after a homeomorphism but I'm out of my depth there... My initial attempt is described below.

I need a transformation $$\psi$$ that maps from points inside a cube $$[-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$$ to the same cube. The way I've tried to do it is by representing the transformation using a multi-output GP (where the outputs are independent). This GP is conditioned such that the border segments of the square are preserved.

$$ X, Y \sim GP(0, k_{RBF}) $$

$$ X, Y : \mathbb R^2 \mapsto \mathbb R $$

$$ \psi : (x, y) \mapsto (X(x, y), Y(x, y)) $$

All results below start with a uniform grid on a square as the one shown below.

## An example of a diffeomorphism

This example is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism) - I wrote an R implementation based on their (Mathematica?) one here.

library(data.table)

diffeo_example = function(n = 10, epsilon = 1.5) {
    grid = data.table(expand.grid(x = seq(-1, 1, length.out = n),
                                  y = seq(-1, 1, length.out = n)))
    x = copy(grid$x); y = copy(grid$y)

    A = 0.5 * epsilon * (0.25 * (cos(pi*x) + 1) *
                                (cos(pi*y) + 1) +
                         cos(0.5*pi*x) * cos(0.5*pi*y))
    grid[, x_new := x - y*A]
    grid[, y_new := y + x*A]
    return(grid)

## Attempt

Below is some R code that simulates the formalisation above. I don't know how to enforce the transformation to be bijective. Some of the samples look good by chance, others not so much.
