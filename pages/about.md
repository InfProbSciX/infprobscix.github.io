I'm a statistician + data scientist in London with interests in statistics, machine learning, computer science, mathematics, science & scientific philosophy.

Proficient with R, Python, Stan & Tensorflow. Studied for an MPhil (Cambridge) and a BSc Hons (Edinburgh) in subjects that may or may not resemble statistics.
