      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Designing and productionizing large-scale statistical models for balance sheet forecasting of term deposits and loans, accounting for customer behavior and economic trends. Modeling mainly involves Markovian models, GAMs and time series models.}
        \item {In addition to this, I assist with and review other model implementations (e.g. for current accounts, savings and mortgages). I also pilot new tools, create knowledge-bases, work on automation and do exploratory work to identify areas of efficiency (e.g. with Spark, Rcpp, Docker). In some cases, I've reduced execution times from days to seconds.}
