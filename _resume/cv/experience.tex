        \item {Designed and productionized large-scale statistical models for balance sheet simulation of term deposits and loans, accounting for customer behavior and economic trends. Modeling mainly involved Markovian models, GAMs and time series models.}
        \item {In addition to this, I assisted with and reviewed other model implementations (e.g. for current accounts, savings and mortgages). I also piloted new tools, created knowledge-bases, worked on automation and performed exploratory work to identify areas of efficiency (e.g. with Spark, Rcpp, Docker). In some cases, I reduced execution times from days to seconds.}
